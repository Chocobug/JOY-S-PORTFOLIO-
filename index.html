                <h3>IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION ON 
                    RECORD KEEPING IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES</h3>
                <p>This study examines the impact of blockchain technology on record-keeping 
within academic libraries, focusing specifically on the John Harris Library.
Using a descriptive survey design, data was collected from eighty 
participants selected through stratified sampling from the University of 
Benin's librarian population. The research employed a questionnaire titled 
"Blockchain Technology in Academic Libraries Questionnaire (BTALQ)" to 
gather information on adoption, impact, challenges, and strategies related to 
blockchain technology. Data analysis utilized descriptive statistics. 
The findings indicate that blockchain technology positively influences 
record-keeping in academic libraries, improving data integrity, reducing 
fraud, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders. However, challenges 
such as technological complexity and regulatory concerns hinder its 
widespread adoption. Strategies like comprehensive training programs and 
collaboration with technology experts prove effective in enhancing 
blockchain application. While librarians display moderate awareness of 
blockchain, practical implementation is constrained by factors like technical 
expertise and institutional support. Recommendations include investing in 
training programs, collaborating with technology experts, allocating 
resources, and conducting further research to explore long-term impacts and 
develop best practices for implementation.</p>

                <h3>Intern  | JOHN HARRIS LIBRARY</h3>
                <p>During my internship at John Harris Library, 
                    I supported feedback gathering, 
                    shelved and organized library materials, 
                    and processed new items including cataloging and labeling. 
                    I provided support during library programs and events, 
                    conducted basic research tasks for patrons or staff,
                     and assisted with administrative tasks such as data entry and preparing displays.</p>
